Apple,4,- good work life balance depending on your team - could be interesting work but your project also depends on how your manager thinks personally of you if you don't get on well you might end up with projects no one wants to work on - great benefits from the company including good food good 401k health insurance etc - supportive environment for personal development,- recruiters are usually bad and unprofessional they usually try to lowball you (as typical) but if you try to negotiate they become aggressive and even rude - very unbalanced compensation even within the same teams study up your numbers well before signing up - secrecy - very non-uniform groups within the company there are big differences between different organizations so you might have totally different experience for the same/similar job responsibilities depending on whether you are part of engineering operations or (scary the one to avoid at all cost) is&t groups,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,-2.0,0.0

at amazon no problem is pushed aside as too hard to solve in fact they go after the really hard and insolvable problems and then throw talent time and resources towards solving them in my time there pretty much every team i worked with was solving a ""holy grail"" problem in their field and actually making progress towards it there is no dearth of interesting projects teams or ideas to work on 2 structure and thinking -

amazon treats you like an owner - a grown up you have a job to do and you are empowered to do it there are checks and balances of course but you truly do own your business you make the assessments take the risks justify your decisions and ultimately reap the benefits or learn from your mistakes and move on there are not many fall-backs and layers to catch you if you are not moving your business forward not a lot of finger poitning for failures either that i saw in fact i would say that if you do not act like an owner you will not be successful at amazon you have to embrace the responsibility and run with it 4 smart people - you'll hear this a lot and personally i think some of the talk is overblown but amazon does indeed have some very very smart and talented people working there i know its a cliche but i did learn a lot from most people i worked with there -

what i said above about structure and documentation while its great to create clarity and shape your thinking it can get in the way of actually doing your work everybody at amazon is juggling so much and constantly writing high quality documents can get exhausting the secret here as in any job is to balance the strategic against the operational and prioritize ruthlessly i cannot say i was always effective at it - but i tried till my last day and now have the benefit of hind sight as well :-) 2 culture - i think some people could have a tough time adjusting to the culture - its tough expectations are high and there is not always a lot of hand holding ( in fact it would be very rare) i think you have to embrace or at least accept it and focus on the positives your team makes a huge difference - so hopefully you're lucky and end up with a great manager and great team mates if you're looking for free food and onsite massages - you certainly will be disappointed you can end up overworked and resentful if you are not good at prioritizing your work and your life and making trade-offs 3 people/politics - i started to see a lot of the ""we are the best in the world"" mentality start to show up i don't believe that everyone that works at amazon is a genius and seeing that attitude crop up every now and then was annoying every company has inside politics and even though amazon tries really hard to believe there is no politics there is certainly that to deal with no more than any other company that i can tell but it can get frustrating when you're working so hard and so long to get derailed by that kind of thing so there you have it - overall i loved my time at amazon i was exhausted (in a very good way) every day but couldn't wait to go back and keep making progress i was lucky to have a great team a really interesting area to work on and some awesome problems to tackle some of the talk is overblown but amazon does indeed have some very very smart and talented people working there i know its a cliche but i did learn a lot",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0

Amazon,2,if you like the feel of a start up but with more security and some of the perks of working for a large org you'll like it at amazon although it really depends on you where you work and what org you work in some places like fashion or ads are amazing management listens and is truly invested in their staff other organizations are incredibly toxic so it's a roll of the dice the pay is ok they try to keep you there by inflating your compensation package with stock that vests slowly over a 4 year time period but the base pay runs between average to slightly below average as a data scientist (or any tech role) you'll likely have total access to the complete aws suite of tools but you'll have to monitor your usage as every group is given a budget for an aws bill don't expect to have access to industry standard tools like stata spss etc,amazon still tries to pretend it's a startup but when you employ 50000+ people that doesn't always work well the systems are often broken or unusable and you are very much thrown into the deep end to figure out how to do anything there's no broad support as a data scientist i was lucky that i had a strong sde background so i knew how to spin up and manage my own emr clusters or how to work with a bunch of different databases to gather results using different code languages as well as knowing both r and python but most people don't have that kind of background and despite having 3 job families for scientists (data research and applied) the role guidelines aren't always followed so sometimes data or research scientists end up doing the work of an applied scientist it's ridiculously competitive some orgs are able to harness that and direct it in healthy ways allowing people to grow and help those around them other orgs will weaponize that competitiveness and create a toxic environment where everyone is either stabbing you in the back or throwing you under the bus regardless of your org though management will put unrealistic expectations on you and just expect you to perform at the very peak of your peers; which means you have to be a super performer 24/7 otherwise you'll get a poor review and will be fired put on an improvement plan (which most folks never recover from and are eventually fired or quit within a year) or given a verbal warning and no compensation review (salary adjustments only happen once a year for everyone at the same time) management also pays lip service to dei but most of it is smoke and mirrors they don't take the time to listen to marginalized communities and when people speak up about injustice they are quickly silenced and the internal affinity groups (also known as ergs in the larger tech world) are gagged by the business they are supposed to advocate for their communities but most of them aren't allowed to do so especially if it rocks the boat too much if you are a cishet white male you'll fit in fine for everyone else it's a roll of the dice,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,4,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-4.0,0.0

Microsoft,5,colleagues are very friendly and sharp competent people: many are recent graduates of local colleges and graduate programs there is a great work atmosphere cultivated by leadership that has been with this department since it was acquired from nokia years ago there are opportunities to make a name for yourself and expand your skill set with challenging projects but also tolerance for us older folks who need to prioritize a work-life balance at some point in their career (and perhaps for that reason this group has a better gender ratio and more parents than most companies or other divisions of microsoft) open to occasional remote work,many colleagues who have been with the department a while are now at a senior level and have a hard time advancing further within the company (there are only so many opportunities for management or high-level independent contributor positions and even fewer are at the boston office specifically) it's a testament to the atmosphere of the team and the quality of the projects that these folks stick around not a problem if you are planning to come in at entry level and ok with potentially switching companies after a few years,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
