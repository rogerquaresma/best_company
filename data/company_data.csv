Politics and turf wars - multiple teams are competing for ownership over the same decisions. Directors will employ their teams as pawns to gain turf and evaluate them on their ability to do so. People treated as competition, not partners - FB will intentionally pit peers to out-do each other, seeing this as a motivational tactic. Churn and turnover - as priorities, ownership, and methodologies change, those part of the prior regime are cast aside.

Unlike SWE, who can prove their impacts by finishing pre-planned coding projects and rolling out pre-planned features, data scientist does not automatically get credit if you only finish beautiful analyses. You have to suggest eng team to apply your suggestion from analysis, and prove how much of the product growth are from your analysis. So sometimes your impact can be subjective. - Skillset. You may be asked to do a lot of ad-hoc analyses from eng team, which I am sure are very important and can guide engineers whether to implement certain features, but that will prevent you from doing some deep dive analyses and learning some new techniques in data analysis. Maybe after a year or two, you will find that you did not build any statistical models or haven't touched any machine learning. But that's the skillset what other companies will ask for when you apply new job. Who cares you did how many ad-hoc analyses or AB test or wrote how many data pipelines. It's the fancy machine learning model that will earn you respect. Also, total pay is lower than SWE for the same level."

The company is getting bigger. This means more room for backroom politics and aligning people without ruffling people's feathers. Very talented individual contributors (and/or good at politics) are being promoted. As a result, instead of having well rounded managers, you end up having either extremely career driven or super awkward managers.

If you have an interest in a topic, most likely someone else is equally interested in teaching you about it. - Many of the little things are taken care of for you: food, laundry, shuttle, gym, etc. It does add up, from both a money and time perspective. - Managers care! I've had better and worse managers, but one unifying theme is that they all have good intentions, which I can't say for every manager I've had in my short career.","- Salary growth can be somewhat linear...and the y-axis (what you start off at), has more weight than it should for a young company. - Easy for performance to all clump together at the above expectations rating, which really makes it difficult to stand out."
Meta,Data Scientist,Jun 20,2015,5,I get to work every day on interesting problems together with incredibly smart and committed coworkers. The internal tools we have in place to perform analysis are world class.,It's very hard to advance your career if you want to have work-life balance. The fast pace and the high demands foster burnout in a lot of employees.
Meta,Simply amazing,Apr 4,2015,5,"Every morning when I go in, I feel like the luckiest guy on earth for ever landing a job here. Projects: Every team is understaffed, so there is a ton of incredibly important work to do everywhere. Because of this, you can work on high-impact (and potentially high-visibilty) projects from Day 1. Autonomy: I've always felt extremely trusted in both my technical competency and prioritization skills. Management is (generally) helpful when I want help, but mostly I've been able to do my own thing and work on whatever project feels most important to the company and/or interesting to me. People: Everyone is really smart, and most people are really friendly, funny, and generally awesome to hang out with. Food: Amazing. Healthy options are phenomenal, as are the unhealthy ones. Gym: The staff is incredible. So much more!","- Stress: The company likes to run slim. As mentioned in the pros above, this means you're always working on impactful projects, but it also means your team is understaffed and you may have to work some nights and weekends to get stuff done (though definitely not as bad as the previous strartup I worked for). The more teams you work with, the worse this can get, since some people love to load up on meetings during the day. Egos: There are some people who are really full of themselves and difficult to work with. This happens anywhere I've been, but there's a special brand of self-importance among some folks here. Fortunately, I've never had to work too closely with these people, but they make their presence known."

The company cares about its employees' quality of life; we have excellent food, shuttles to/from San Francisco, a culture that eschews meetings, great ergonomics, onsite medical care, and a gym. New engineers go through ""bootcamp,"" which exposes you to all aspects of the codebase in a friendly environment where you're allowed to ask n00bish questions and bond with other new engineers.","It's difficult to come up with meaningful downsides to working here.

I felt it strongly during covid and when I had family crisis. We even have covid paid leave to sort those kind of things out. I think this is really positive for diversity and inclusion. - Much less politics than other places I have been. The company is still in rapid growth phase and people are too busy getting stuffs done rather than fighting with each other. - I quite like people I work with. High achievers and fast learners. And everyone is nice & collaborative possibly because the culture filters out those who are not",- In many teams you are busy 4-6pm London time because of meetings with US west coast. You need to actively manage your work life balance particularly if you need to pick up kids by 6pm. WFH helps a lot. And the company/ team respects people's boundaries. For example I tell my team I need to stop at 5:30pm everyday and the US colleagues would accomodate and get up early for me.

The project has lost most of its key personnel because the Director for Product was unable to give a clear direction, and censored all the reasonable ideas. My manager was inexperienced and refused to hear any suggestion that I made. It felt really demoralising and frustrating. I reached out to other managers, friends from previous job who agreed that it was frustrating… but that’s it. – I agree, this is a horrible situation. – What can I do about it? – I don’t know… – Wait a year, so I can change teams? – Maybe. That was changed to 18 months though. All three of the Org, the project and my manager had ""the worst Pulse rating in the history of the company"" at their level, according to people who had been at Facebook longer. No one reached out. Several key stakeholders left, notably one senior Data engineer. I offered to take over some of their workload because I knew how and I badly needed data to do my own work.

Meta,"Great Product, People and Values",Aug 23,2015,5,"Facebook is a great place to work. Its not often that you can say that you work on a product that you genuinely believe in in a company with great values and with the best caliber people. Facebook is such a place. Nobody at Facebook is there accidentally. The interview process is intentionally tough because Facebook would rather have more False Negatives than False Positives (ie they would rather be wrong they give someone a No Hire than be wrong when go ahead a hire someone). What this means is that you are working with some of the best people in the world. Also the values that the company believes in truly important. Its great to work for a place that is so open with its Employees. Since Facebook's product is all about Social, the company makes sure that employees feel free to express their opinions. Everyone is encouraged to weigh in on important decisions. The company structure is such that we dont get fancy titles and therefore we end up being more equal. Move fast is also important, and the company removes all obstacles from employees so that they can do their job well. Overall I love working at Facebook and would recommend it to everyone.","Since the company is focused on impact, work life balance could be better.

They usually try to lowball you (as typical) but if you try to negotiate, they become aggressive and even rude. - Very unbalanced compensation even within the same teams. Study up your numbers well before signing up. - Secrecy - Very non-uniform groups within the company.

Very toxic team environment, never encouraged for cross training and change of responsibility. People around you working on same things for more than 5 years. If you ask for change in responsibility or cross training manager would decline. Manager expect you to work on same thing every day. You would have no motivation lack of new responsibilities and challenges. Very micro managing by manager feels like you are working in store as an hourly employee so you have to answer for every minutes you worked on which task. You need to take permission from your manager for 1:1 with their managers. You have to include your manager as an optional in all meetings you schedules with your stakeholders so your manager keep an eye on you."

They usually try to lowball you (as typical) but if you try to negotiate, they become aggressive and even rude. - Very unbalanced compensation even within the same teams. Study up your numbers well before signing up. - Secrecy - Very non-uniform groups within the company. There are big differences between different organizations so you might have totally different experience for the same/similar job responsibilities depending on whether you are part of engineering, operations or (scary, the one to avoid at all cost) IS&T groups."

This is especially true for those in management positions. As a result, decisions made are often too conservative. There are lots of talking points about how the org is innovating what a finance department can do but most of the people who do the innovating leave as soon as they can. Not a gateway to Google: I joined thinking that the I could work in Finance for a while learning new skills and working on cool projects on my way to moving into the eng org. This is generally not the case. What I didn't realize when I joined is that I was on a Finance ladder. As a result, transferring to the eng org involves a full interview process. These interviews are (from many people I've talked to) more stringent than the external ones. Ask which ladder you'll be placed on before accepting the offer!

Amazon,Do Not Recommend Operations in Luxemburg,Feb 8,2020,2,- Amazon name and title on resume,"- Total metric overload: entire meetings go by with staff quoting dozens of metrics and people just going along as if an actual meeting is taking place. Metrics support your ideas and points they should not lead it. - Political: giving impressions of doing work is unfortunately more important than actually doing good work...a downside to a large corporation that has become hierarchical. If you don't promote your own work you won't get recognition. The Culture is hollow: people are nice and friendly but there is a dramatic cavity where there should be enthusiasm and joy. Friday night get togethers? nope. Coworkers hanging out during work? nope. People are friendly yes, respectful yes, but absolutely soulless compared to other tech companies. - Unfortuanately Hierarchial and not flat. I have not experienced such a hierarchial organization since i left insurance a dozen or more years ago. - the office in luxemburg is focused on operations and not product development---> would not recommend this to anyone looking for actual data science work."

Amazon,Hmm,Apr 19,2022,4,"What are the pros and cons of working at Amazon? I recently left Amazon to start my own venture. I was there for a little under 2 years. The answer to your question will of course, vary by the person answering but in my perspective, it was the highlight of my career. It is a tough and demanding environment but I truly enjoyed my work and my time there, Below are the pros and cons based on my experience Pros 1. Big problems - At Amazon, no problem is pushed aside as too hard to solve. In fact, they go after the really hard and insolvable problems and then throw talent, time and resources towards solving them. In my time there, pretty much every team I worked with was solving a ""holy grail"" problem in their field and actually making progress towards it. There is no dearth of interesting projects, teams or ideas to work on. 2. Structure and thinking - There is a lot of document writing at Amazon, in case you have not heard. While some people do not like that part of the job much, I think the required meetings and documents force every employee to truly think about their job and what they are doing. Producing the write-ups and getting them ready to face up to a room of very detailed scrutiny and questioning forces you to think through every aspect of your business. it is really a very valuable skill that Amazon does a great job of developing. 3. Ownership - Amazon treats you like an owner - a grown up. You have a job to do and you are empowered to do it. There are checks and balances, of course, but you truly do own your business. You make the assessments, take the risks, justify your decisions and ultimately reap the benefits or learn from your mistakes and move on. There are not many fall-backs and layers to catch you if you are not moving your business forward. Not a lot of finger poitning for failures either, that I saw. In fact, I would say that if you do not act like an owner, you will not be successful at Amazon. You have to embrace the responsibility and run with it. 4. Smart People - You'll hear this a lot and personally, I think some of the talk is overblown but Amazon does indeed have some very, very smart and talented people working there. I know its a cliche, but I did learn a lot from most people I worked with there - and again, I say, most, not all :-) are just genuinely nice people. I would work again with these people without hesitation. I think the leadership there is especially great - just really smart, experienced people with sharp instincts, great insights and lots of ambition. It was really fun working with the folks I did.","What are the pros and cons of working at Amazon? I recently left Amazon to start my own venture. I was there for a little under 2 years.

There are not many fall-backs and layers to catch you if you are not moving your business forward. Not a lot of finger poitning for failures either, that I saw. In fact, I would say that if you do not act like an owner, you will not be successful at Amazon. You have to embrace the responsibility and run with it. 4. Smart People - You'll hear this a lot and personally, I What are the pros and cons of working at Amazon? I recently left Amazon to start my own venture. I was there for a little under 2 years. The answer to your question will of course, vary by the person answering but in my perspective, it was the highlight of my career. It is a tough and demanding environment but I truly enjoyed my work and my time there, Below are the pros and cons based on my experience Pros 1. Big problems - At Amazon, no problem is pushed aside as too hard to solve. In fact, they go after the really hard and insolvable problems and then throw talent, time and resources towards solving them. In my time there, pretty much every team I worked with was solving a ""holy grail"" problem in their field and actually making progress towards it. There is no dearth of interesting projects, teams or ideas to work on. 2. Structure and thinking - There is a lot of document writing at Amazon, in case you have not heard. While some people do not like that part of the job much, I think the required meetings and documents force every employee to truly think about their job and what they are doing. Producing the write-ups and getting them ready to face up to a room of very detailed scrutiny and questioning forces you to think through every aspect of your business. it is really a very valuable skill that Amazon does a great job of developing. 3. Ownership - Amazon treats you like an owner - a grown up. You have a job to do and you are empowered to do it. There are checks and balances, of course, but you truly do own your business. You make the assessments, take the risks, justify your decisions and ultimately reap the benefits or learn from your mistakes and move on. There are not many fall-backs and layers to catch you if you are not moving your business forward. Not a lot of finger poitning for failures either, that I saw. In fact, I would say that if you do not act like an owner, you will not be successful at Amazon. You have to embrace the responsibility and run with it. 4. Smart People - You'll hear this a lot and personally, I think some of the talk is overblown but Amazon does indeed have some very, very smart and talented people working there. I know its a cliche, but I did learn a lot from most people I worked with there - and again, I say, most, not all :-) are just genuinely nice people. I would work again with these people without hesitation. I think the leadership there is especially great - just really smart, experienced people with sharp instincts, great insights and lots of ambition. It was really fun working with the folks I did. Cons 1. Structure and documentation - What I said above about structure and documentation, while its great to create clarity and shape your thinking, it can get in the way of actually doing your work. Everybody at Amazon is juggling so much and constantly writing high quality documents can get exhausting. The secret here, as in any job, is to balance the strategic against the operational and prioritize ruthlessly. I cannot say I was always effective at it - but I tried till my last day and now have the benefit of hind sight as well :-) 2. Culture - I think some people could have a tough time adjusting to the culture - its tough, expectations are high and there is not always a lot of hand holding ( in fact, it would be very rare). I think you have to embrace or at least accept it and focus on the positives. Your team makes a huge difference - so hopefully you're lucky and end up with a great manager and great team mates. If you're looking for free food and onsite massages - you certainly will be disappointed. You can end up overworked and resentful if you are not good at prioritizing your work and your life and making trade-offs. 3. People/Politics - I started to see a lot of the ""we are the best in the world"" mentality start to show up. I don't believe that everyone that works at Amazon is a genius and seeing that attitude crop up every now and then was annoying. Every company has inside politics and even though Amazon tries really hard to believe there is no politics, there is certainly that to deal with. No more than any other company that I can tell, but it can get frustrating when you're working so hard and so long to get derailed by that kind of thing. So there you have it - overall I loved my time at Amazon. I was exhausted (in a very good way) every day but couldn't wait to go back and keep making progress. I was lucky to have a great team, a really interesting area to work on and some awesome problems to tackle. some of the talk is overblown but Amazon does indeed have some very, very smart and talented people working there. I know its a cliche, but I did learn a lot"

Amazon,Bountiful Opportunities and High Integrity,Sep 10,2018,5,"Amazon wants their employees to work on projects where they can use their best strengths. Because Amazon has so many teams working on so many different products, you can find a great fit for your combination of strengths. Most people who work here are bright, hardworking and of good character.","Most people who work here have high standards, especially of themselves, so people feel a lot of pressure from within. This can lead to people being a bit negative. In a large organization and at the huge scale of Amazon, it is difficult to take a big idea from conception to deployment. It is hard to know who owns what, how to navigate the organization and inject a new idea into an existing budgeted and approved roadmap."
Amazon,Good work life balance if you’re on the right team.,Jun 6,2019,5,"I hear this is certainly not true for every team, but I think my team is great and I’m very happy at Amazon. - My work life balance is great. I hardly ever have to work more than 40 hours/week. The few times that I do, I don’t particularly mind since I rarely have to. - My team and manager are really chill. Nobody cares when I get to the office, when I leave, or exactly how many hours I was there. I’m certainly expected to get my work done, but I feel like I have a lot of freedom to work on my projects however I’d like. I also work from home about once a week. - This is especially true for Amazon Web Services (where I work) but I feel fortunate that I can learn how to use all the services on AWS for free. My field uses AWS pretty extensively, but it’s normally pretty expensive if you want to use it a lot. We get it all for free and we use it a lot in our everyday work, so I feel pretty lucky to be able to learn it.","- Compared to other tech companies Amazon is undoubtedly very cheap. We have to pay for all of our own food, the food is expensive, and it’s also mediocre. Parking isn’t even free. Our benefits are okay but not as good as other tech companies. Our office space looks fine but pretty minimalist. I find this to be minor in the grand scheme of things but it’s definitely noticeable. - I dislike being on-call. I’m on call for a week at a time about once every two months. During that time you’re handed a pager and you have to be available 24/7 for issues. This could potentially be on a random weekend afternoon, 8 am in the morning, or worst of all, the dreaded 3 am pager ringing. Fortunately I’m not on-call all that often so I just suck it up and deal with it whenever it rolls around."

Amazon,Great Company with Limitations,May 17,2023,5,"I have been working at Amazon as a Data Scientist for over two years now, and overall, it has been a positive experience. The company offers a fast-paced and challenging work environment, which has allowed me to grow both professionally and personally. The opportunities for learning and development are abundant, and the company invests heavily in training programs and resources. Amazon has a strong focus on innovation, and it's exciting to be part of a company that is constantly pushing boundaries and introducing new technologies. The work culture is inclusive and diverse, and there is a strong emphasis on collaboration and teamwork. Overall, Amazon is a great company with plenty of opportunities for growth and development. However, it's important to be aware of the demanding nature of the work and the potential challenges that come with it. If you thrive in a fast-paced and competitive environment, Amazon can be an excellent place to work.","However, it's important to note that Amazon's high expectations and demanding workload can be overwhelming at times. The work-life balance can be challenging to maintain, especially during peak periods or when there are tight deadlines. The pressure to deliver results quickly can lead to long hours and high stress levels. Another aspect that can be frustrating is the limited work autonomy. Decisions are often driven by data and metrics, which can sometimes hinder creativity and flexibility in problem-solving. Additionally, the hierarchical structure can make it difficult to drive change or have a significant impact on decision-making processes."

I got to visit a few cities around the U.S. and even travel internationally * Work-life balanced is manageable. Could be a lot better if there weren't so many time-sucking unnecessary internal processes, but it's not nearly as bad as Amazon's reputation if you google ""Amazon work-life balance""","* Amazon is enormous, and as bureaucratic as you'd guess based on that size. I probably bookmarked 200 well-meaning internal sites / tools my first week. * Gender diversity was awful on my team. I think it was something like 80 employees, 3 women. * Travel in AWS Professional Services is a lot more manageable than at management consultancies, but it can still wear you down. I'd say on average I got about 10 days notice before traveling * Internal communication tools are awful. You have to use Amazon-created, kind-of-ok alternatives to the stack you'd use at a modern company. e.g. Amazon Chime instead of Slack, Microsoft Outlook instead of Google Calendar, etc."

If you really cannot find one, the environment allows you to freely propose with leadership to support and provide resources.","- Hard to maintain work-life balance: Late-night/morning meetings, last minute ad-hoc priorities, and inflexible timeline, etc. - Constant changes in leadership or focus: Might not apply to every org, but moving fast means sacrificing some of the spent effort and shifting focus on 'immediately important' stuff. - Competition between teams: It does not necessarily become unhealthy, but if it does, usually is because of work in similar nature competing for visibility/implementation."

Amazon,All depends on who you work for,May 22,2022,2,"If you like the feel of a start up but with more security and some of the perks of working for a large org, you'll like it at Amazon. Although it really depends on you where you work and what org you work in. Some places, like Fashion or Ads, are amazing. Management listens and is truly invested in their staff. Other organizations are incredibly toxic. So it's a roll of the dice. The pay is ok. They try to keep you there by inflating your compensation package with stock that vests slowly over a 4 year time period. But the base pay runs between average to slightly below average. As a data scientist (or any tech role), you'll likely have total access to the complete AWS suite of tools, but you'll have to monitor your usage as every group is given a budget for an AWS bill. Don't expect to have access to industry standard tools like Stata, SPSS, etc.","Amazon still tries to pretend it's a startup but when you employ 50,000+ people that doesn't always work well. The systems are often broken or unusable and you are very much thrown into the deep end to figure out how to do anything. There's no broad support. As a data scientist, I was lucky that I had a strong SDE background so I knew how to spin up and manage my own EMR clusters or how to work with a bunch of different databases to gather results using different code languages, as well as knowing both R and Python, but most people don't have that kind of background. And despite having 3 job families for scientists (Data, Research, and Applied), the role guidelines aren't always followed so sometimes Data or Research scientists end up doing the work of an Applied Scientist. It's ridiculously competitive. Some orgs are able to harness that and direct it in healthy ways, allowing people to grow and help those around them. Other orgs will weaponize that competitiveness and create a toxic environment, where everyone is either stabbing you in the back or throwing you under the bus. Regardless of your org though, management will put unrealistic expectations on you and just expect you to perform at the very peak of your peers; which means you have to be a super performer 24/7. Otherwise, you'll get a poor review and will be fired, put on an improvement plan (which most folks never recover from and are eventually fired or quit within a year), or given a verbal warning and no compensation review (salary adjustments only happen once a year for everyone at the same time). Management also pays lip service to DEI but most of it is smoke and mirrors. They don't take the time to listen to marginalized communities and when people speak up about injustice, they are quickly silenced. And the internal affinity groups (also known as ERGs in the larger tech world) are gagged by the business. They are supposed to advocate for their communities but most of them aren't allowed to do so, especially if it rocks the boat too much. If you are a cishet white male, you'll fit in fine. For everyone else, it's a roll of the dice."

Microsoft,Great work atmosphere at Cambridge location,Apr 16,2019,5,"Colleagues are very friendly and sharp, competent people: many are recent graduates of local colleges and graduate programs. There is a great work atmosphere cultivated by leadership that has been with this department since it was acquired from Nokia years ago. There are opportunities to make a name for yourself and expand your skill set with challenging projects, but also tolerance for us older folks who need to prioritize a work-life balance at some point in their career. (And perhaps for that reason, this group has a better gender ratio and more parents than most companies or other divisions of Microsoft.) Open to occasional remote work.","Many colleagues who have been with the department a while are now at a senior level and have a hard time advancing further within the company. (There are only so many opportunities for management or high-level independent contributor positions, and even fewer are at the Boston office specifically.) It's a testament to the atmosphere of the team and the quality of the projects that these folks stick around. Not a problem if you are planning to come in at entry level and OK with potentially switching companies after a few years."
Microsoft,Follow your passion and you can have a great career here,Feb 27,2019,4,"Opportunities abound and you can explore a wide variety: different stages of businesses (research, incubation, startup, mature), different roles (software engineer, data scientist, etc.), different regions (USA, China, etc.), and many other dimensions. Make sure you know what your management chain values and how their performance is evaluated and work on projects that align to their values and performance goals. Great people to work with, challenging problems to solve, and the culture continues to improve. When you start a project, you don't know it yet, but there will be at least a half dozen other teams doing the similar work with whom you will collaborate and learn.",Performance rewards are based on impact but we don't quantify impact.. How and why rewards were given has become a black box. You will always be able to find a company that offers more pay/rewards.
Microsoft,A company that lives its values,Dec 17,2019,4,"Microsoft's mission is to empower others, to help them achieve more, which is something you can feel good about, especially if you're passionate about technology. When you show up to work, you can feel like you're making a positive difference in the world, and you get to work on cutting-edge technology. Moreover, leadership is thoughtful about the culture it fosters. They try to create a collaborative work environment, encourage people to have an open mindset, celebrate diversity and inclusion, support continuous learning, and more. The company truly lives its values.","People are still people, so some situations will be better than others."
Microsoft,Microsoft,Jun 14,2016,4,"Good work life balance. Lots of respect from people you work with. Great managers who cares about you. Lots of very talented people. Family oriented culture, people respect your personal time. Even if you don't like something, it will likely to change organically in a few months.","Slow to get promotion. Even if you are a top performer, you might not get recognized well enough due to managers peanut buttering the review results. Hard to get things done with such a large org. Too many people to criticize your work without doing anything."
Microsoft,Optimization of the business often trumps human factors,Dec 28,2018,3,"1. Good pay to work-life balance ratio: if you're trying to maximize income with decent constraints on your level of effort and time, then MS is probably a good choice. 2. Offices! Single occupancy offices for most of the Redmond-based employees! 3. Hierarchy is surprisingly flat in many parts of the company. This is true at most companies, and it's certainly true here. If you get along with your immediate manager, you will find your time here tolerable.","1. MS keeps dogfooding its products on employees and moving people around: both re-orgs and office moves. The company has an optimizing culture that neglects its effects on humans. Then they try to compensate in the worst way possible: corporate initiatives. Growth mindset, inclusivity, etc. They'll put up posters and send out emails that people just ignore or mock. 2. They are gradually converting offices to open space. 3. Tons of politics. Much of the old guard feel obligated to justify their employment; they attempt to ""own"" as much as possible, usually to the detriment of projects and the mental health of individual contributors. 4. The left hand doesn't know what it's own fingers are doing, let alone the right hand. There is a lot of duplicated work, competing internal technologies (cf. Skype and Teams), and a complete lack of communication across different parts of the company."
Microsoft,Great place for a data scientist,Jan 18,2018,5,With most Microsoft products getting online the amount of data you get to work with is enormous. A lot of low hanging fruit (few people looked at the data before you) means you can generate a lot of impact. Great infrastructure for working with large volumes of data means you spend more time analyzing the data and less worrying about processing it efficiently.,"You need to be skilled in corporate politics. Not everyone is bought into being data driven, and ownership issues may get on the way."
Microsoft,"Great benefits, great people in pockets",Nov 22,2019,4,Great benefit. Great work-life balance. You will find very knowledgable people in pockets across MSFT (not only in MSR).,To make a business impact teams are doing similar things in complete isolation. Little to no co-operation. Least bothered about the product but more important is to make the business impact. There are teams where people are still holding on to the old framework and reinventing the wheel. No intention of adapting the changes with recent developments.
Microsoft,"Secure, frustrating, ultimately uninteresting",Mar 5,2014,2,Compensation was good. Job security. Data at large scale means there's potential to do some interesting work.,"Difficult to impossible to do meaningful interesting work. Physical and process infrastructure is so slow and so much contention for the few interesting projects that it's all about positioning, rarely about doing good work. In my area (software engineering as applied to big data problems) not being able to use open-source technologies means your skill set will quickly become obsolete."
Microsoft,"Good place to work, with drawbacks",Jun 24,2019,4,People generally are very kind and intelligent. Some very interesting projects.

There are no shortages of learning opportunities and we are encouraged to focus on learning and skills development.","Data tooling is constantly in flux and the UX is awful.
