My interviewers seemed highly inexperienced. They didn't introduce themselves and tended to start the interview by just stating questions. One interviewer in particular was condescending from the very beginning, and refused to give any clarification when I asked specific questions about what kinds of users product was interested in. Another asked a follow-up question that would have made it totally pointless to address the problem with their preferred approach. It often felt like despite the open-endedness of the questions, I was expected to give a single, predetermined answer decided by the interviewer. This made it difficult to build upon my initial work because the interviewer often expected a totally different approach. The structure of the interview itself was an initial recruiting call, then phone technical screener, then recruiter prep call, then virtual on-site. The whole process took about three months, plus another two weeks to get the result due to the hiring freeze.

Google,write code to generate iid draws from distribution X when we only have access to a random number generator,"Jul 1, 2020","Anonymous Interview Candidate in New York, NY",No Offer,Negative Experience,Application,"I applied through a recruiter. The process took 4 weeks. I interviewed at Google (New York, NY)","Sailed through the initial phone interview (a series of technical stats questions) and then moved to a virtual onsite. This was 5 back to back 45min interviews with other employees, and no break in between sessions. With one exception, everyone seemed rushed, unhappy, and totally uninterested in their work. One interviewer was nearly impossible to communicate with bc of echoing sounds on mic and poor English language skills. It was live coding and or doing math in a Google doc for 90% of the time on complex problems that interviewers seemed to expect a quick simple answer for, rather than a discussion of trade-offs under different scenarios. Responses to my follow up questions were generally misleading or unhelpful. The most useless ""brain teaser"" task was to derive the CDF of an exotic distribution I had not worked with before but could simply be looked up in 2s on Wikipedia. This came after three other questions I had already solved. I'm not sure what they're selecting on here but it was a genuinely bad experience and the interview day provided a strong signal that it would not be a good fit for me. Not surprised about the outcome, but it was a real waste of my time and the recruiter provided zero feedback about the rejection because of ""NDA policy"".","11 people found this interview helpful

Google,NDA.,"Mar 7, 2020",Anonymous Interview Candidate,No Offer,Positive Experience,Application,I applied online. The process took 2 months. I interviewed at Google,"Had one session of phone screening and five sessions on site in one day earlier this year. Every session lasted 45-60 minutes. Passed the phone screening with very positive feedback but failed at on-site stage with good feedback on two skills and bad feedback on another two skills (the recruiter said the ‘places for improvement’ instead of ‘bad’).
 
 
 
 I do not want to specify the location but let me just say it was outside of US. All interviews were still done in English.
 
 
 
 Every session was one vs. one and every interviewer kept typing while I was answering, which you should assume in any Google interviews. This is because they were asked to give complete record of what I spoke for the hiring committee to give final decision. I was not sure if I should slow down while they were typing hard. I would ask them whether I should slow down if I could have a next chance since one of the feedback was ""my communication could be more structured"". Although there were differences in the personalities including a good/bad 'chemistry' to mine, everyone was nice and responsive.
 
 
 
 Any of on-site sessions were designed to mix the skill sets to test e.g. stats, data insight, coding, and communication, which teased my brain a lot. Every interviewer asked me 3-5 questions, around 20 questions in total. One question was in my back pocket already from googling “data scientist interview questions”, most of others were new but somewhat similar to them, and a few were something I never imagined. Still, the preparation based on what we can find through googling helped me a lot in answering their questions and was definitely worth doing.
 
 
 
 I knew I made one obvious mistake in stats question (which was not easy in general but I should have answered correctly because I had ever done that and even put it in my resume; also I have 10+ years of experience in applied stats). Other than that, my overall after-math impression was “my answers should be fair enough” and hoped one mistake in 20 questions did not a lot harm. In reality they pointed out not only that I did not do a good job in stats questions but also that I lacked one other skill. I guess that error in stats question was not the only reason of the consequence. As we know, they may offer another follow-up session if the candidates are close enough to the bar, which I didn’t receive.
 
 
 
 One thing which I feel a bit surprised was that every stats question came with simulation coding exercises. One stats question was obviously easy to answer in an analytical solution but they requested the solution in simulation coding (I checked with the interviewer if it was). Some other stats questions asking “probability of the event” was impossible to answer analytically and even difficult by simulation; I could not answer well on site but probably I should have defined Classes and class instances to simulate the situation (I assumed Python). Sometimes they asked in a way that “how do you get the probabilities of xxxxx” and ended up with the simulation solution, other times they directly asked “how do you code the simulation model to get the probabilities of xxxxx”.
 
 
 
 As I saw somebody else posted about Google interview experience, there is no guarantee that what the recruiter promised in advance really comes true. In my case, there were a few differences from what the recruiter had told me.
 
 1. There was no break between the session (except the lunch break), the next interviewers were just waiting outside the room or accidentally called in before the prior session ends. Literally no break even for a single minute or water break. I might have had one if I had asked for, but it looks like every interviewer had a predetermined set of questions they had to finish during the session. They were always in a little rush. 
 
 2. The recruiter told that the coding test would be about data wrangling, but it was more like general one like list handling or a lot of simulation ones. Let me skip the details here because I already put enough above.
 
 3. Recruiter said I would code on PC with my choice from R or Python on RStudio or Jupyter (or whatever other platforms you like), but actually I was not allowed to use my own PC and the actual choice was Google doc on office Chrome book, white board coding, or even brain coding when neither of two was available. Either way, they did not care the quality as a code. I made a lot corrections on the fly and wrote some lines in math forms but still had a positive feedback about coding skill.
 
 
 
 Overall, it was my first Google interview and though the consequence was not something I expected, I am proud of my own performance. They say there are many Googles who were hired at second interview opportunity or even later. Also, the luck does some game in any life opportunities; Google interview is not the exception. I recommend anyone with experience which can be qualified with their requirement giving a first shot. Good luck!","16 people found this interview helpful

 Phase 1: Discussion with the Recruiter
 
 I interviewed for the same role one year ago. I didn't get through and the recruiter at that time refused to provide any specific feedback stating that they were not allowed to share. However, when I reapplied, the recruiter was very helpful and basically walked me through an ""approximate"" feedback of how I did last time and what went wrong. 
 
 
 
 First technical screen (telephonic): I skipped this part. 
 
 
 
 General Cognitive Ability: This interview focused on business case study like questions (2) and lasted 45 minutes. The idea was to 
 
 1. Understand the question and the context quickly
 
 2. Come up with a structured approach towards the solution
 
 3. Discuss the questions posed by the interviewer in the middle of the conversation
 
 
 
 Overall, preparing for the business case interviews helped me for this interview. The interviewer generally focused and asked questions about the technical aspects of the problem and most of the discussion after coming up with the structure was technical in nature (e.g. What are some ways to effectively reduce the dimensionality of the data? Which models you will pick to answer this (classification) problem and why ? Compare the approach with others etc.)
 
 
 
 Technical Round (Stats and ML, 45 minutes): This was relatively easy I would say. The interviewer asked to code a simple problem related to string manipulation and percentile calculation. On the ML bit, most discussion hovered around MLE concepts, CI and Hypothesis testing basics. Overall, not very difficult and the interviewer was very helpful.
 
 
 
 Leadership (45 minutes): In this round , interviewer focused on questions related to leadership experiences in the past and asked for examples showcasing initiative, handling conflicts and pushing / advocating for ideas. The questions were very open ended and the interviewer was very helpful. I suggest writing down 10-15 behavioral questions in advance for practice (which I didn't do).
 
 
 
 Googlyness (45 minutes): This was simply a rehash of Leadership type questions. The interviewer came prepared with 7-8 classic behavior interview questions and asked them one after the other. By the end I was very tired and I suspect this is the interview which DQed me.","24 people found this interview helpful

Google,tree traversal,"May 12, 2020","Anonymous Interview Candidate in Seattle, WA",No Offer,Neutral Experience,Difficult Interview,"I applied through college or university. The process took 1 week. I interviewed at Google (Seattle, WA) in Jan 2018","The interview process doesn’t reinvent the wheel. Typically, Google uses a two-stage interview process. The first stage is a phone interview (or, more often, a Google Hangout interview). The second stage is an in-person interview. Only finalists will make it to the second stage of the interview process.
 
 
 
 The interviews themselves can vary slightly depending on how technical the job at hand is expected to be. For more technical positions, the interview process may include a shared Google Doc where the applicant can write code or algorithms and show them to the interviewer in real time. This system allows the interviewer to ask technical questions that require a demonstration of skills.
 
 
 
 In general, Google is looking for candidates who excel in four different categories: general cognitive ability, leadership, role-related knowledge, and ""Googleyness."" Googleyness is basically a synonym for company culture fit and integration.
 
 
 
 In the past, Google has been famous for asking off-the-wall interview questions like, ""How many piano tuners are there in the world?"" These questions were used to assess creativity, reasoning, and problem-solving skills -- among other things. In recent years, Google has pulled back a bit on the odd questions, though they still crop up from time to time according to applicants.","3 people found this interview helpful

Apple,"Describe for me in detail the difference between L1 and L2 regularization, specifically as regards the difference in their impact on the model training process itself","Nov 7, 2017","Anonymous Interview Candidate in Cupertino, CA",No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,"I applied through a recruiter. The process took 3 weeks. I interviewed at Apple (Cupertino, CA) in Oct 2017","Initial interview steps were quite straightforward. Good conversation with the hiring manager, lots of alignment between my skills and their needs. Moved forward to technical screen, 1 hour of Python exercises and general data science reasoning. I'm not a brilliant coder but I was able to talk through my solutions and their shortcomings so I got invited to a full day on-site.
 
 
 
 That's where things went sideways. Apple is incredibly secretive about the interview process, so not only did they not tell me who I would be meeting with, they refused to even tell me what subject matter would be covered. Naturally, I prepared in line with what I had discussed with the hiring manager and given my understanding of the role. I was then blindsided by interview after interview of highly technical machine learning and software development practice interviews, none of which focused on the actual application areas that were at the core of the role (NLP and dataset management). It was almost as if I was suddenly interviewing for a different job. Needless to say, things didn't work out.

I interviewed at Apple (Santa Clara, CA) in Apr 2017","Internal Apple recruiter reached out to me on LinkedIn, and set up a a phone call between me and one of the team members. It was a technical phone screening. Then I moved on to the next phone screen with the team lead, which was another technical phone screen. Then another call with the recruiter to set up the onsite interview. The onsite interview consisted of a 40 minutes presentation which I prepared a lot for. I had 8 rounds of interviews in one day with 8 people form the team and other teams. Some interviews were technical and some behavioral. I was there onsite from 10AM with back-to-back interviews. The recruiting coordinator ""forgot"" to schedule a time for lunch. So I had to go through the day without eating until 5PM. Rooms were not reserved for some interviews and we had walk around to find an available room. It was a total mess. After 8 rounds of interviews and 40 minutes of presentation I was done. 
 
 
 
 After more than 1 month that I did not hear from them, I sent an email to them asking for some feedback. they said we are working on it and will get back to you. I again did not hear form them for another two weeks. So I sent another email again asking for feedback. Then the recruiter called me and said all the reviews were great, and all the candidates were good, it was a hard decision and we had to move forward with the candidate who go the highest score. 
 
 
 
 That's fine if you do not want to move forward with an applicant. But not giving them any feedback for more than one month, and blaming it on ""we are very busy, and have too much on our plates"" is not an acceptable excuse. Candidates spent days preparing for such interviews and it is very disrespectful not to even care to email them back with the decision. I am sure had I not emailed them, I would not have heard back for another month. very disrespectful!","13 people found this interview helpful

 On-site:
 
 5 back to back interview sessions (1 hour each). First was discussing projects I worked on, and felt more behavioral (although technical questions were asked). Next three were technical sessions in experimental design/hypothesis testing, machine learning/data engineering with white board coding (SQL type rather than algorithms), and statistics/probability, in that order. Final interview was mix of behavioral/case study session with more business oriented. 
 
 
 
 Many of the questions on-site were framed in case studies (A/B testing, defining and monitoring performance metrics, etc), and I was expected to think through the entire process. None of the technical questions were super difficult nor were there trick questions, but you should know your basics in stats/machine learning/programming to do well.

The process took 4 weeks. I interviewed at Microsoft in Sep 2017,"I couldn't find any interview reviews on glassdoor for the Data Scientist Intern position, so I hope this helps someone!
 
 
 
 I applied online at careers.microsoft.com for a software engineering internship role (I'm 90% sure it was that role), and I got an email for an on-campus interview. They didn't mention which role I'd be interviewing for. This had one typical technical question that you could find in Cracking the Coding Interview, but I think I messed it up and assumed I failed the process.
 
 
 
 Three weeks later, I got an email inviting me to the on-site interviews + a dinner at a fancy restaurant the night before. I prepared for questions from CTCI (they didn't mention which team/role I'd be interviewing for, so I assumed it would be software engineering).
 
 
 
 There were four interviews - all of them had data science questions, and there was maybe one typical CTCI question among all four interviews. The interviews felt like conversations and I felt very comfortable talking to the people (I wasn't sure what their exact positions were and were too scared to ask at that point - they all worked in a data related field but it sounded like software engineering for the most part).
 
 
 
 Thankfully, most of the interview questions were things I already knew from prior databases classes + statistics + calculus classes. There was one question I didn't know how to answer about a machine learning algorithm, but I think the interviewer was fine that I didn't know it.
 
 
 
 Tips: Ask your recruiter which POSITION you're interviewing for - I asked for about the team instead, and they told me I'd be interviewing with multiple teams (but I meant position). Also, learn the differences between a position (data scientist), team (machine learning studio), and group (Azure, for example).
 
 
 
 Overall, I'm super happy with the outcome - I originally didn't apply to this role because I felt underqualified, but the interviews weren't that bad.","22 people found this interview helpful

During this phone call we talked about my formation, my experience, what is this internship about, in which team, ... . Then after I received a mail saying that they were very impressed during the phone call and they would like to have on face to face interviews in Dublin.
 
 I am from France so after a week were they organised the whole trip (flight, hotel, food, taxi, ... everything is paid for you, the hotel was a 4*!), I went to do face to face interviews.
 
 I had one person who followed me the whole day, who was very cool and made me at ease. And then I did 4 interviews :
 
 1st : We talked about my experience, project and the team
 
 2nd : Technical questions on Data Science
 
 3rd : Technical questions on software Dev, but also ""if I say, money is not a problem what would be the job of your dream?""
 
 4th : Technical questions on software Dev, but also ""What is for you the difference between a Data Scientist and a software engineer?""
 
 All the process was quite intense, I had only 5 minutes to drink a glass of water between each interview and all is going very quickly. But the interviewer were very cool, easy to talk with and we really managed to make a conversation more than an interview.
 
 
 
 At the end they proposed me an offer directly!
 
 
 
 Tips to suceed: 
 
 - Make it a 2 ways conversation rather than an 1 one interview. This means that you have to PREPARE questions to ask. Personally I had 5 question for each category (Technical Questions, Questions about working in Microsoft, Questions about life at microsoft).
 
 - Be enthusiastic, dynamic and smiling
 
 - Don't overthink technical interviews, they are pretty cool and can help you if you have some problems. If you have the minimum level required you can't fail it if you know how to build on their indications.","10 people found this interview helpful

It included a screener, phone interviews and onsite interview. Interestingly though, Microsoft's screener was an online test of basic math and probability. In terms of the logistic of the process, I got a little confused for having to deal with multiple recruiters within Microsoft. However, they were all friendly, prompt and reasonably helpful. 
 
 
 
 Questions asked include my education and research background, statistics, basic probability, machine learning and coding. Interviewers came from different background and are experts at what they do, so be prepared for questions that require some well thought out answers.
 
 
 
 Microsoft is pretty generous for their onsite interview, so you will have a good time (not the best though, Adobe offered $100 daily meal reimbursement =p ). 
 
 
 
 Overall, the experience was great. It was quite different than the impression of a middle age corporation that I had in mind before I went to the interview.

I interviewed at Amazon (Seattle, WA) in Mar 2021","Contacted by recruiter to apply to another position (a level below one I qualify for), applied instead to a few position at my level. Got emailed to set up interview, responded same day and interview was scheduled within 3 business days. Gotta give it to them for being efficient. Asked recruiter to provide information about position and process, instead got a 3-page brochure (basically lists all of data science as are of interview, so it was useless).
 
 Interview was with a mid-level Data Scientist on the target team. She was polite, but described nothing useful about the position and moved on quickly for lack of time (looks like they follow a script and try to fit too much testing into one hour). Interview proceeded well from my side, but the interviewer did not turn on her camera, and did not comment on any of my answers, leaving me in the dark--I only had my own guesses to go on when it comes to what she expected me to focus on. Leadership Principles weren't explicitly mentioned, but they're garbage anyway, many of them are direct contradictions of each other, so it's impossible to adhere to them, just depends on how the interviewer is feeling about it, really. Asked about my background, asked to do an easy SQL question (didn't know a function I needed, so I asked if I could look it up and was allowed to, quickly looked up and implemented--would be funny if that's what got me out of the process). Last 15 minutes of interview was behavioral questions, asked to use examples from my resume. Interviewer suddenly focused and kept digging deep into one part of one project I had with no indication of what she was after. I could have asked, but didn't at the moment as I was eager to move on and answer the original question. Line of questioning wasn't related to the question and felt hostile. I believe the interviewer may have had trouble with what she was questioning about on her team, so wanted to know more, but the example I was using wasn't suited to her questions. I get it now, wish I'd realized it during the interview. Overall, everything else seemed to go swimmingly, but got rejection anyway. I'd say that the process seems extremely subjective, gives me pause to apply again. Also seems Amazon is really proud of using ""more complicated methods"", so if your background is more real-world (i.e. you're not working for a data company that provides its data scientists with clean data and plenty of time to play around with model parameters and feature building), don't do what I did and show them how efficient and resourceful you are with limited resources, they just can't relate. Stick to short and clear examples of implementing your most complicated models. Be ready for either arrogance or aggression as their ego starts feeling threatened. They will be sure to try flexing muscle as you talk about an area they are skilled at (I found it distasteful, but kept my cool). Also, huge negative is refusal to give interview feedback.
 
 
 
 Remember one thing for Amazon interviews: liability. They will not give you feedback. They will ask you in detail about projects and expect that you did everything perfectly in your experience and in your coding question. They don't care if you did something impressive or innovative, they just want someone who will avoid mistakes.","5 people found this interview helpful

Amazon,Can you write a code for xyz?,"Jan 29, 2021",Anonymous Interview Candidate,No Offer,Negative Experience,Easy Interview,I interviewed at Amazon,"I believe everyone knows about the interview process at Amazon. It is long, tiring, boring and simply a waste of time. 
 
 I am proud to withdrew my application after the first round. Details are given below. I hope this will help someone. 
 
 In my personal opinion, asking a candidate to code during the interview is useless because in the real scenario no one codes in that limited time. Secondly, if you want to test the coding skills then give a take home test or ask for something like a GitHub account. 
 
 I fail to understand that the so called ‘Geniuses’ sitting in Amazon overlooking this process simply don’t get it that anyone can code...what really matters is the logic behind that code...so ideally they should be testing the candidates on that. 
 
 In my case I refused to code during the interview. Unfortunately the interviewer was so inexperienced that he had no clue what other questions to ask. It was both frustrating and funny. The interviewer went silent for few minutes and then abruptly ended the call. This happened not once but almost 4-5 times with me. I did write my concerns to the HR who came back and told me that they cannot change the process so I humbly told her that I am not interested in Amazon. For me it is a waste of time and energy. 
 
 Advise to the Amazon team -
 
 1. Kindly treat the interviewers as equals. You do not own their career. It is always your loss. Amazon is not the only company with jobs in the world
 2. Good companies do not take more than 2 to 3 rounds. If you need more rounds then your team is clearly inexperienced to judge candidates quickly
 3. Train the interviewers to ask smart questions and not the text book questions 
 4. Coding is not the real skill...logic is. Anyone can copy paste a code if they understand the logic behind the problem
 5. You have a 6 months cooling period. Your interview process is 6 months long so it is precisely 1 year","5 people found this interview helpful

I interviewed at Amazon (Seattle, WA) in Sep 2020","Hey, guys writing this out coz I’ve used glassdoor so much to get a sense of what to prep. Thanks for the posts and here’s to paying it forward :)
 
 Applied with Referral, the first time I did not get picked up, applied again with another colleague, and got a call the next day! The recruiter reached out and asked me a time for a phone screen I took a date 2 weeks out.
 Had two phone interviews, and 5 onsite interviews later. All interviews had a common theme - a mix of technical and LP questions. Some interviews were more towards LPs and others were more towards technical. 
 Regarding LPs, I’d say prepare solid stories, write them down, and even practice them with your friends. Make the stories diverse, talk about stories from different company experiences, do not repeat stories from one particular company, it’ll undermine your years of experience. I did that and was given L4 even though I applied for L5.
 
 Regarding Technical questions, questions were regarding:
 Machine Learning -- ML system design(given a business problem, design the architecture from start to end output), Explain inner workings of Tree-based methods and Random Forest in detail, Regularization general idea why and when to use, L1 vs L2, explaining PCA in details with multiple use based cross-questions, code up gradient descent in python, among other questions.
 
 Stats:
 A/B testing, hypothesis testing, end-to-end A/B test design for a business problem, a bunch of random stats questions, time-series overview of ARIMA, and applying to the business case above, among other questions...
 
 All cross-questions were such that they pushed me towards going into more and more detail of the topics, they want to understand they I knew things properly.","24 people found this interview helpful

The interviewer was very nice. They asked me questions around my resume, then I presented my case study. The interviewer asked me tons of technical questions (how does dropout work, what are some ways you could have improved the model, what is the difference between L1 and L2 regularization). If I had passed this round, final round would be a 5 hour super day mainly around leadership principles.
 
 I received an email rejection a couple days after. I had not been able to answer some of the technical questions, which is my guess for why I did not pass. They do not provide feedback, which is extremely disappointed. Be aware of this before investing time in completing the case study that - if I knew this ahead of time I would not have completed the case study.

Amazon,"A lot of behavioural questions based on the Amazon Principles as well as general questions about algorithms, machine learning and A/B testing. Signed an NDA, cannot reveal much more","Apr 14, 2019",Anonymous Interview Candidate in Berlin,No Offer,Neutral Experience,,I applied online. The process took 2 months. I interviewed at Amazon (Berlin) in Mar 2019,"I originally applied for a Research Scientist position in Berlin. Within a week I received a response from the recruitment team which followed by 2 technical phone interviews that I completed within the next 4 weeks or so. The technical interviews went well and I was invited for an offsite ""onsite"". Since the recruiting team were all based in the US, the ""onsite"" had to be conducted remotely. 
 
 
 
 They asked me to wait before they can actually work out the time and date of the onsite. After about 6 weeks of waiting (it was actually all happening over Christmas, hence the extended waiting period) the recruitment team returned to me and said that the position was cancelled. 
 
 
 
 About 3-4 weeks later the same recruiter reached out to me and asked me if I'd consider a Data Scientist (Fraud Prevention Team at AWS) role in Berlin, I said yes. Then I spoke with a different recruiter on the phone who took me through the rest of the process from here: just one more phone interview and then the onsite (not a remote one this time). About 2 weeks after that, I passed another technical phone interview and about a month later I was invited to attend an onsite interview. Again, the entire team was based on the US so my onsite was scheduled to go from 1pm to 7pm.
 
 
 
 I was initially preparing myself for a rough recruitment process, but in the end, I thought that the recruitment process wasn't that difficult. The most challenging part was during one of the phone interviews when I was asked a tricky coding question and I thought I screwed it up, but they still wanted to go ahead with my application. As for the onsite itself, I was very well prepared and I was extremely happy with my own performance. However, a week later I received a call from the recruiter who said that they decided not to hire me. She also said that unfortunately they cannot give me any feedback as it's against their policy, but they did encourage me to apply for other roles with Amazon.
 
 
 
 If you are interviewing with Amazon, here is what I would recommend:
 
 
 
 - Spend some quality time on LeetCode or HackerRank as it will definitely help you
 
 - Do not underestimate the behavioural questions and you will be asked a whole tone of these. To get ready for these questions don't just read prepare examples from your career that relate to Amazon Leadership Principles, but actually look for questions based on these principles. For example, the ""Are Right, A Lot"" principle might translate into a question such as ""tell me about a time when you've made a mistake at work and what did you learn from it?""","4 people found this interview helpful

 Recruiter reached out to me regarding the role. I agreed to interview. The recruiter was scattered and unorganized. The questions had no flow, and she asked at several points, ""do you have any questions? ""
 
 
 
 I pass the recruiter screen. Next step is the take-home assessment. Completed the assessment - looks good, moving on to manager phone interview.
 
 
 
 Time to schedule a phone interview. The recruiter has a second recruiter, a recruiter's assistant I guess? It took about 10 emails to agree on a time. Recruiter 1 sends a couple time slots for the manager -> I say yes to at least 2 slots -> recruiter 2 comes back and tell me those times doesn't work, how about these ones. We finally agree on a time.
 
 
 
 Finally, it's time - the manager calls 5 mins late for a 30 min interview, it's not the worst. Then he starts with ""Do you have any questions?"". He asked a couple follow-up questions on my assessment, then, in his dreamy state seems to realize he ran out of questions to ask. He returns to ask me once again ""Do you have any questions?"". The supposedly 30-minute interview ends in 12 minutes. 
 
 
 
 Through the last Q & A with the manager, I learn that they have extended a couple offers for the roles. They will call me back if any of the offers are declined. So that tells me - 1. they are unorganized and careless 2. they think my time is free. IF you are waiting on other candidates - fine, but call to interview me when the position is ready, and you are ready with good questions. 
 
 
 
 Very careless and not very professional throughout. Will not continue in the process and will not be applying to this company in the future.","5 people found this interview helpful

 Their final offer is 50-60K lower than what I was told originally. So the business is definitely struggling.
 
 
 
 Inappropriate conduct with candidates:
 
 One of the interviewers spent 10 minutes pressing me on a question about a subtraction function(A,B). It's either A-B or B-A. I didn't remember, so I said we could look at the documentation. After not getting the answer for a couple minutes, this person got frustrated and yelled at me ""I'm the documentation. I'm telling you that..."" I was shocked that an interviewer could behave this way.

Meta,"We have this product, we have this goal, how would you go about figuring how we can adress this problem?","Mar 1, 2021","Anonymous Interview Candidate in London, England",No Offer,Negative Experience,Application,"I applied through a recruiter. The process took 7 weeks. I interviewed at Meta (London, England)","A recruiter reached out asking if I would be interested in interviewing. An initial screening call was simply to cover my background, what I was looking for and some skill sets. They asked some behavioural questions and basic technical questions. My answers seemed to go into more depth as she noted that she didnt need to cover the sql questions she normally asks. 
 
 
 
 The next stage was an hour interview with an existing senior data scientist. He was friendly but we seemed to be speaking at cross purposes. His English was not perfect and his background seemed to be from software engineering so perhaps it was destined to be more difficult than it might have been. He pushed hard in a certain direction, then claimed I was going too deep. Finally, ten minutes later he came back and touched once again on the topic which confused me. Clearly he was not satisfied but he didnt reframe his question and when prompted to clarify just said ""what do you think?"". Had I gone too deep or had I not addressed the issue enough? Despite this, he was very friendly and was eager to answer and address any question or concern if only answering superficially. 
 
 
 
 A boiler plate one line rejection email followed. No feedback is offered as a policy. However, arrogantly they solicit candidates to give them feedback. Yet more time demanded entirely for Facebooks benefit.","2 people found this interview helpful
