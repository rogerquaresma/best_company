793,Amazon,Good work life balance if you’re on the right team.,5,"I hear this is certainly not true for every team, but I think my team is great and I’m very happy at Amazon. - My work life balance is great. I hardly ever have to work more than 40 hours/week. The few times that I do, I don’t particularly mind since I rarely have to. - My team and manager are really chill. Nobody cares when I get to the office, when I leave, or exactly how many hours I was there. I’m certainly expected to get my work done, but I feel like I have a lot of freedom to work on my projects however I’d like. I also work from home about once a week. - This is especially true for Amazon Web Services (where I work) but I feel fortunate that I can learn how to use all the services on AWS for free. My field uses AWS pretty extensively, but it’s normally pretty expensive if you want to use it a lot. We get it all for free and we use it a lot in our everyday work, so I feel pretty lucky to be able to learn it.","- Compared to other tech companies Amazon is undoubtedly very cheap. We have to pay for all of our own food, the food is expensive, and it’s also mediocre. Parking isn’t even free. Our benefits are okay but not as good as other tech companies. Our office space looks fine but pretty minimalist. I find this to be minor in the grand scheme of things but it’s definitely noticeable. - I dislike being on-call. I’m on call for a week at a time about once every two months. During that time you’re handed a pager and you have to be available 24/7 for issues. This could potentially be on a random weekend afternoon, 8 am in the morning, or worst of all, the dreaded 3 am pager ringing. Fortunately I’m not on-call all that often so I just suck it up and deal with it whenever it rolls around.",9,2019-06-06,Data Scientist
823,Amazon,Like getting paid to get a masters degree,4,"I worked for AWS Professional Services, the consulting arm of Amazon Web Services. * AWS invests a LOT in your education. 6 weeks of just onboarding, including AWS paying for certification training classes and certification exames * Access to internal AWS accounts makes it easy to experiment and learn * My coworkers were brilliant, and I learned a lot from them * Access to unique customer challenges and datasets * Pay was great, 30% higher than what I was making in my previous job * For a while, some of the travel is great. I got to visit a few cities around the U.S. and even travel internationally * Work-life balanced is manageable. Could be a lot better if there weren't so many time-sucking unnecessary internal processes, but it's not nearly as bad as Amazon's reputation if you google ""Amazon work-life balance""","* Amazon is enormous, and as bureaucratic as you'd guess based on that size. I probably bookmarked 200 well-meaning internal sites / tools my first week. * Gender diversity was awful on my team. I think it was something like 80 employees, 3 women. * Travel in AWS Professional Services is a lot more manageable than at management consultancies, but it can still wear you down. I'd say on average I got about 10 days notice before traveling * Internal communication tools are awful. You have to use Amazon-created, kind-of-ok alternatives to the stack you'd use at a modern company. e.g. Amazon Chime instead of Slack, Microsoft Outlook instead of Google Calendar, etc.",5,2020-04-20,Data Scientist
731,Amazon,Good company but it could be so much better,4,flexible working hours work from home there are many smart people around you who are more than willing to share their knowledge,work-life balance not so good highly political flying economy on inter-continental flights no matter your level very rigid HR compensation could be better no perks such as a car on leasing no food provided on campus no tech courses (such as Machine Learning University) in Europe,3,2018-09-17,Data Scientist
375,Apple,Not all it's cracked up to be,3,There is a certain recognition you receive when others hear you work for Apple with it being the high flyer in the industry. There is some flexibility in the hours as long as you get your work done.,"Ivory tower management that tends to be in the way more than helping. They often make decisions that the people who do the work don't understand and hurts productivity. After cutting down benefits quite a bit during the lean years (mid 90's), has done nothing to bring any of them back now that we are making a killing.",7,2009-09-20,Data Analyst
459,Apple,Like being back in school,1,"Salary, Food and Free shuttle bus from MRT-station","Too much micro-management Always monitored by management. Can barely go to toilet without getting message from boss about being inactive. Too high expectations from Management to hit KPI - they care more about quantity than quality. No team morale. Management don't even introduce you to your colleagues when you start. No communication with management except for when you do something ""wrong"" like taking too long to get your coffee.",6,2019-05-07,Data Specialist
263,Apple,great place to learn. slow to grow.,4,"At the beginning you can learn a lot and see how a big company works. Depending on teams, data scientists have a lot of freedom.",Unstructured. Infra structure is not as great as some other big companies. Growth is slow which is natural for big companies.,5,2019-04-11,Senior Data Scientist
572,Google,Avoid the Finance Org!!,2,"Great tech infrastructure systems, but it's hard to know which ones to use. This is usually served by having senior team members who know what they're doing, but teams in Finance generally don't have that (employee churn)","Innovation is nonexistent: too many in the company are from non-tech / corporate backgrounds. This is especially true for those in management positions. As a result, decisions made are often too conservative. There are lots of talking points about how the org is innovating what a finance department can do but most of the people who do the innovating leave as soon as they can. Not a gateway to Google: I joined thinking that the I could work in Finance for a while learning new skills and working on cool projects on my way to moving into the eng org. This is generally not the case. What I didn't realize when I joined is that I was on a Finance ladder. As a result, transferring to the eng org involves a full interview process. These interviews are (from many people I've talked to) more stringent than the external ones. Ask which ladder you'll be placed on before accepting the offer! (This is also why the offer was FAR lower than what I expected)",6,2019-08-16,"Data Scientist, Finance"
640,Google,google,5,"The money’s great!

514,Google,Great perks and overall structure but does not live up to stated ethics and ideals,4,Great job security Clear path to promotion Smart colleagues Excellent career development resources Diverse workplace Creative freedom and autonomy Effective feedback processes,Can be quite political Multiple teams working on the same project Some loud and disrespectful employees Sexual and racial harassment/discrimination happens more often than it should given their external messaging/image they project Not true to their stated ethics,2,2021-09-29,Senior Data Scientist
158,Meta,Data Scientist,2,"Good perks and comp, coworkers are nice and fun",Very competitive environment. No possible to succeed if you don’t work 60+ hours. Focus on short term impact due to performance cycle every 6 months. No clarity on expectations of roles. Mix signals from leadership about culture,24,2019-03-02,Data Scientist
107,Meta,"overall is good, but you need know what project is best for you",4,"- great opportunity to work with the smartest people from the world - most products have billions of users so your work have a big scope - beautiful campus, good snacks, foods, and benefits","If you are a data scientist, you need to really care about two things: - Impact. Unlike SWE, who can prove their impacts by finishing pre-planned coding projects and rolling out pre-planned features, data scientist does not automatically get credit if you only finish beautiful analyses. You have to suggest eng team to apply your suggestion from analysis, and prove how much of the product growth are from your analysis. So sometimes your impact can be subjective. - Skillset. You may be asked to do a lot of ad-hoc analyses from eng team, which I am sure are very important and can guide engineers whether to implement certain features, but that will prevent you from doing some deep dive analyses and learning some new techniques in data analysis. Maybe after a year or two, you will find that you did not build any statistical models or haven't touched any machine learning. But that's the skillset what other companies will ask for when you apply new job. Who cares you did how many ad-hoc analyses or AB test or wrote how many data pipelines. It's the fancy machine learning model that will earn you respect. Also, total pay is lower than SWE for the same level.",22,2019-04-05,Data Scientist
145,Meta,Getting Corporate,3,- Food - Health care benefits - Fringe benefits - Nice campus - Corporate shuttles - State of the art tech stack - Extremely smart coworkers - Visionary and bold top management,"Work/life balance can get hurt as a lot of folks at the office are single and do not understand the needs of having a family. The company is getting bigger. This means more room for backroom politics and aligning people without ruffling people's feathers. Very talented individual contributors (and/or good at politics) are being promoted. As a result, instead of having well rounded managers, you end up having either extremely career driven or super awkward managers. Some of those middle managers are very green, making it even more painful. Some women feel like they have to be extra tough at work because of the Leanin coolaid, making them very hard to work with.",19,2015-06-17,Data Scientist
